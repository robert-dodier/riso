<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>RISO is an implementation of distributed belief networks in Java.
See <a href="http://riso.sourceforge.net">the RISO home page</a> for general information,
and <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/riso">the Sourceforge project page</a>
to download files, submit bug reports, etc.</p>

RISO can be installed in two ways:
(1) either all the RISO classes can be installed on every 
host, or (2) the classes can be installed on one host,
with other hosts obtaining classes automatically through
the Java codebase mechanism.
Instructions are given for both installation methods.
Even if RISO is installed on only one host,
a distributed belief network can still be executed;
however, all the nodes in the belief network have to be
on that one host.</p>

<p>It's assumed in these instructions
that you have already
installed the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and/or
Java Development Kit (JDK).
You should be able to find a version of the JRE suitable for 
your system at <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>.</p>

<p> Instructions are given only for Linux.
For installation on other systems,
probably the best approach is to install from the jar file (as described below)</p>

<p><em>(Optional for any installation)</em> Download and unpack the archives
containing examples and documentation:
<b>riso-20020129.javadoc.tar.gz</b>, <b>riso-20020129.rates.tar.gz</b>,
and <b>riso-20020129.web.tar.gz</b>.
You don't need those files to complete the following instructions.</p>

<p><h2> Installation #1: Stand-alone Host</h2>
<p>To install class files and run applications on one host:

	<ol>
        <li><p>Download the RISO class files.
        Get the files from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50166">the Sourceforge file manager</a>.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p><em>Installation from rpm:</em>
            You want the most recent rpm named "riso-YYYYMMDD-N.noarch.rpm".</p>
            <p><b>rpm -ih riso-YYYYMMDD-N.noarch.rpm</b></p>
            <li><p><em>Installation from jar:</em>
            You want the most recent jar file named "riso-YYYYMMDD.jar".
            The jar file contains the same files as the rpm.</p>
            <p><b>cd /usr/local; jar xvf riso-YYYYMMDD.jar</b></p>
            <p>(You probably need superuser privileges for that.)</p>
            <p>NOTE: The jar file is NOT executable as it stands; you must unpack it.</p>
        </ul>
	</li>
    <li><p>Set your classpath to point to the RISO classes.</p>
        <p><b>export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/riso/classes</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Hello, World example</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Start the RMI registry.</p>
        <p><b>rmiregistry &amp;</b></p>
	</li>
    <li><p>Start a belief network context.</p>
        <p><b>java riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -c mycontext</b></p>
        <p>It's preferable to execute this command in a separate command window;
        it will produce a lot of debugging output.</p>
	</li>
    <li><p>In another command window, load a belief network into the context.
        First paste a belief network description into a file.</p>
<pre>
cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; /tmp/mybn.riso
riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetwork mybn
{
  riso.belief_nets.Variable X
  {
    type continuous
    distribution riso.distributions.Gaussian
    {
      mean 50
      std-deviation 17
    }
  }
}
EOF
</pre>
    <p>That creates a file named <b>/tmp/mybn.riso</b>.
    Now load that belief network into RISO.</p>
    <p><b>java riso.apps.PublishNetworkString -c localhost/mycontext &lt; /tmp/mybn.riso</b></p>
    <p>There are other means of loading a belief network into a context.
	See <a href="bnc-pn-rq.html">these notes on using RISO programs</a>.
	</p>
	</li>
    <li><p>Now obtain a reference to the loaded belief network and work with it.
    Here is the belief network equivalent of "Hello, World".</p>
<pre>
java riso.apps.RemoteQuery
&gt; localhost/mybn
?
X ?
</pre>
<pre>
[robert@chromium riso-info]$ <b>java riso.apps.RemoteQuery</b>
Hello, I'll read the stuff you type. See: http://riso.sf.net/bnc-pn-rq.html
<b>&gt; localhost/mybn</b>
RemoteQuery: url: rmi://localhost/mybn
  obtained reference: BeliefNetwork_Stub[UnicastRef [liveRef: [endpoint:[127.0.0.1:21099](remote),objID:[-5e2409bd:10e5408bc2a:-8000, 1]]]]
<b>?</b>
RemoteQuery: context chromium:1099/mycontext; belief network:
riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetwork mybn
{
        % context: chromium:1099/mycontext
        riso.belief_nets.Variable X
        {
                type continuous
                distribution riso.distributions.Gaussian { mean 50.0  std-deviation 17.0 }
        }
}
<b>X ?</b>
RemoteQuery: posterior for chromium/mybn.X, elapsed 0.268 [s]
        riso.distributions.Gaussian { mean 50.0  std-deviation 17.0 }
</pre>
<p><b><tt>&gt; localhost/mybn</tt></b> causes RemoteQuery to obtain a reference to the belief network.
<b><tt>?</tt></b> causes RemoteQuery to print the description of the belief network.
<b><tt>X ?</tt></b> causes RemoteQuery to
    compute the posterior distribution of <b>X</b> and print it.</p>

    <p>See <a href="bnc-pn-rq.html">these notes on using RISO programs</a>
    for more information about how to use <b>RemoteQuery</b>.</p>

    <p>There are other RISO applications,
    and it's easy to write more; all that "RemoteQuery" is doing is
	to use the RMI registry to obtain a remote reference, and then it's executing
	method calls using that reference. </p>
	</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p><h2> Installation #2: Client/server</h2>

<p>In this scenario,
you install class files on one host, and load classes automatically from clients
using the Java codebase mechanism.</p>

<p>First follow the instructions above for the machine which will host the class files.</p>

<p> Then follow these instructions for each client.
(NOTE 2006/10/16: The following did work at one time. 
However it's probable that the details are out-of-date.)</p>

	<ol>
	<li><p> <em>(On the server)</em>
	Install the RISO class files where they will be accessible by
	a web server on the host.
	For some web servers, a URL such as "http://somehost/~foo" resolves
	to the directory "/home/foo/public_html".
	In that case, 
<pre>
cd /home/foo/public_html
jar xvf /usr/local/riso/riso.jar
</pre>
	will unpack the files.</p>

	<p>You'll need to figure out what works on your server.</p>

	<li><p><em>(On the server)</em>
	Start up a web server on the host.
	For some web servers, it's something like
<pre>
cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
./httpd start
</pre>
	Again, you'll need to figure out how to do this on your system.</p>

	<p>There used to be a simple server distributed with Java,
	for the express purpose of serving files for RMI;
	maybe there still is. You might want to look into that.</p>

	<li> <p><em>(On the server)</em>
	Extract the stub application, <tt>RemoteApp.class</tt>. This is contained in one class file
	in riso.jar. 
	Use the command
<pre>
jar xvf /usr/local/riso/riso.jar riso.general.RemoteApp.class
</pre>
to extract "RemoteApp.class" (on the host).
Then copy "RemoteApp.class" to each client.</p>

<p><em>(On the client)</em>
	On each client,
	copy <tt>RemoteApp.class</tt> into a directory named <tt>riso/general</tt>.
	This is the only file that needs to be installed permanently on the client.</p>
	</li>
	<li> <p><em>(On the client)</em> Execute the RMI registry on each client.
<pre>
rmiregistry &amp;
</pre>
	</p>

	<li> <p><em>(On the client)</em> Create a belief network context using the stub application.</p>

	<p>Set environment variables to run the stub application.</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <p><tt>export CLASSPATH=riso/general:$CLASSPATH</tt></p>
		<li> <p><tt>export RISOHOST=the.class.file.server.something</tt></p>
		<li> <p><tt>export JAVALOCATION=~foo/or/something</tt></p>
		<li><p> <tt>export CODEBASE="java.rmi.server.codebase=http://$RISOHOST/$JAVALOCATION</tt></p>
		</ul>
		<p>IMPORTANT: Don't forget the trailing backslash on the codebase!</p>

		<p>Now execute the stub and tell it to execute the context in turn.</p>
	<pre>
java -D$CODEBASE riso.general.RemoteApp -c riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -a -c my-context
	</pre>
	<p>This will product a lot of debugging information.</p>

	<!-- <p>
		It may be helpful
		to put the belief network context in a shell loop, so that if it
		dies (heaven forbid, of course),
		it will restart automatically. Here is one way to arrange that:
	<pre>
while true; do
  java -D$CODEBASE riso.general.RemoteApp -c riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -a -c my-context
done
	</pre>
		</ul>
		</p> -->

		<li> <tt>RemoteApp</tt> can execute other applications.
		See the <a href="bnc-pn-rq.html">notes
		on some RISO apps,</a> and these
		<a href="riso-misc.html">
		other notes on RISO apps</a>.
		<!-- The general syntax for <tt>RemoteApp</tt> is:
<pre>
java riso.general.RemoteApp -c NameOf_RISO_ClassHere -a ArgsForAppHere
</pre> -->
		
		<p> For example,
	<pre>
java riso.general.RemoteApp -c riso.general.RegistryPing -a $RISOHOST
	</pre>
	tells what belief networks and contexts are running on a particular host.</p>
	</ol>
</li>
</ul>
