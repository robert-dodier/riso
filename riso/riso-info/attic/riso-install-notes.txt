RISO, an implementation of distribution belief networks in Java,
can be retrieved from the RISO project home page noted above.
The source files are collected into one zip archive, and the
class files are collected into another. The source code archive
also contains several example belief network descriptions (with
the .riso filename extension). 

If you want to recompile the source code:

I am using IBM JDK 1.1.8 for Linux (RedHat Linux 6.1, kernel 2.1.12).
My command interpreter is tcsh.

You need to create the directories referred to as $RISO_HOME and
$JAVA_CLASSES. Unpack the RISO source code archive into $RISO_HOME.
Then:

	1.  setenv RISO_HOME $HOME/[something appropriate]
	2.  setenv JAVA_CLASSES $HOME/[something appropriate]
	3.  setenv CLASSPATH $JAVA_CLASSES
	4.  alias javac 'javac -d $JAVA_CLASSES'
	5.  alias rmic 'rmic -d $JAVA_CLASSES'
	6.  cd $RISO_HOME
	7.  javac numerical/*.java java-general/*.java
	8.  javac riso/*/*.java riso/distributions/computes_*/*.java
	9.  rmic riso.belief_nets.{BeliefNetwork,BeliefNetworkContext,Variable}
	10. rmic riso.remote_data.Remote{Observer,Observable}Impl

To execute RISO:

	0. Unpack the RISO class archive into $JAVA_CLASSES (if you are not recompiling)
	1. rmiregistry &
	2. java riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -c ctxt1 -pa $RISO_HOME/examples
	3. java riso.apps.PublishNetwork -c localhost/ctxt1 -r murphy

You will want to execute step 2 in a separate xterm (or redirect stdout and stderr
to a file or maybe /dev/null) since BeliefNetworkContext produces lots of
debugging output.

At this point, you can execute this:

	4. java riso.apps.RemoteQuery

and type "> localhost/murphy" to see a list of variables, then maybe "?" to get
a print-out of the belief network, and then "B ?" to get the posterior
distribution for the variable B.

See the RISO project home page under the heading "Online documentation for RISO software"
for information on how to use RISO to do still more interesting things.
