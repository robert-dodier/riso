<h1>Man Page for <tt>bnc</tt>, <tt>pn</tt>, and <tt>rq</tt> -- RISO
programs</h1>
<p> Here are some notes on RISO programs. <br>
</p>
<p>The compiled RISO class files can live either on a remote host or on
the local host. If on a local host, the RISO classes are loaded by the
Java runtime from the directory or archive specified in the $CLASSPATH
environment variable. If on a remote host, a stub program (RemoteApp)
is executed from a local class file, and RISO classes are loaded from a
codebase, that is, from an http server.
</p>

<h2><tt>bnc</tt> -- Create RISO belief network context</h2>
<p> Local class files:<br>
<tt>bnc</tt> is an alias for <tt>jre
riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext</tt><br>
Remote class files:<br>
<tt>bnc</tt> is an alias for <tt>jre RemoteApp -c
riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -a</tt>
</p>
<p> This program takes these command line arguments. The program
processes the arguments, then continues to run, waiting for <tt>pn</tt>
to request that one or more belief networks
be loaded. <tt>bnc</tt> prints very verbose debugging messages to
stderr; one can redirect
these messages to a file or to /dev/null as need be<tt><tt>.
</tt></tt></p>
<table align="center" border="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>-c <em>contextname</em></tt></td>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; Specify the name of the context. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>-po <em>port</em></tt></td>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; Specify the port number of the RMI registry in
which the context name will be advertised. The default port is 1099,
the standard RMI registry port. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>-pa <em>directory</em>:<em>directory</em>:<em>directory</em>...
      </tt></td>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; Specify directories in which to search for <tt>.riso</tt>
files. The directories are separated by colon, not by space.
Directories are searched in the order specified. The current working
directory is always prepended to the list. </td>

<p><tt> Example: </tt></p>
<pre><tt> $ bnc -c my-context -po 1077 -pa $HOME/belief-nets:$HOME/more-nets &gt; my.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;<br></tt></pre>
<p><tt> This creates a context named <tt>my-context</tt>, which can be
accessed
through port 1077, and which loads belief networks from the current
working
directory, and <tt>/home/dodier/belief-nets</tt>, and <tt>/home/dodier/more-nets</tt>,
in that order.
This assumes that there is an RMI registry running on port 1077, i.e.
you have
already executed <tt>`rmiregistry 1077'</tt>.
Debugging messages are printed to stderr, which is redirected into the
<tt>my.log</tt> file in this example.

<h2><tt><tt>pn</tt> </tt>-- Publish RISO belief network</h2>
<p> Local class files:<br>
<tt><tt>pn</tt></tt> is an alias for <tt><tt>jre
riso.apps.PublishNetwork</tt><br>
</tt>Remote class files:<br>
<tt><tt>pn</tt></tt> is an alias for <tt><tt>jre RemoteApp -c
riso.apps.PublishNetwork -a</tt>
</tt></p>
<p> This program takes the following command line arguments. The
program processes the arguments, then exits.<tt> </tt></p>
<table align="center" border="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>-c <em>hostname</em>/<em>contextname</em></tt></td>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; The belief network will be published in the
specified context on the specified host. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>-b <em>beliefnetworkname</em></tt></td>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; Bind the name of the belief network. This
makes the belief network visible to within the context by <tt>-c</tt>.
The name cannot already be bound in that context. The belief network is
found in a file called <tt><em>beliefnetworkname</em>.riso</tt>,
somewhere on the list of paths known to the context; directories are
searched in the order they were specified by the <tt>-pa</tt>
arguments. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>-r <em>beliefnetworkname</em></tt></td>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; Rebind the name of the belief network. If the
name is already bound, the previous binding is destroyed and the new
binding becomes active. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>-u <em>beliefnetworkname</em></tt></td>
      <td> &nbsp; &nbsp; Unbind the name of the belief network. If the
name is already bound, the previous binding is destroyed. The belief
network is marked "stale", which means that every operation on the
belief network will fail. However, its context remains alive and
usable. </td>
    </tr>

<p> Continuing the bnc example: </p>
<pre><tt>  pn -c spruce/my-context -b monitor3<br>  pn -c spruce/my-context -r monitor3 -b monitor1<br>  pn -c spruce/my-context -b combine<br>  pn -c spruce/my-context -u monitor1<br></tt></pre>
<p> The first example loads the belief network from the file
monitor3.riso and binds it to the globally visible name monitor3.
The second example reloads and rebinds monitor3.
The third example loads and bins combine. Since that belief network
refers to other belief networks, those others are loaded and bound as
needed. monitor1 and monitor3 are already loaded and bound,
but monitor2 is not, so it is loaded and bound.
The fourth example unbinds monitor1 and marks it stale; then
all operations on monitor1 will fail.<br>
</p>
<p>The files monitor1.riso, monitor2.riso, monitor3.riso, and
combine.riso, must exist in one of the directories named in the search
path&nbsp; (`-<span style="font-family: monospace;">pa</span>' option)
when the belief network context was launched by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">bnc</span>.<br>
