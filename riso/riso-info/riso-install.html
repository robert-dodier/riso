<p> <h2> Overview</h2>
<a href="index.html">RISO</a>
is a Java implementation of distributed belief network algorithms.
RISO allows one to load belief networks onto various hosts,
and link the individual belief networks into one grand belief network.
The polytree inference algorithm is employed, in which messages
in the form of probability distributions and likelihood functions
are passed between hosts; the communications medium is the Internet.
RISO uses the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system of Java
to handle message passing; this makes it possible to write code
in which messages look like function return values, but in reality
the messages are blocks of data being passed over the Internet.

<p> RISO was developed by 
Robert Dodier at the University of Colorado, Dept. of Civil Engineering,
as part of the research for his dissertation,
under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.kassoc.com/kreider/index.html">Prof. Jan Kreider</a>.
RISO may be copied, modified, and redistributed under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
RISO is now hosted at SourceForge.net;
there is more information about RISO at the
<a href="http://riso.sourceforge.net">RISO home page</a>
and you can download documents, examples, and source code from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/riso">RISO project page</a>.

<p> <h2> System Architecture</h2>
<p> RISO uses Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) to copy function arguments and
return values from one host to another.
RMI in turn is based on socket connections, and handles all the details of
managing connections for RISO.

<p> A variable in a belief network may name any other variable, in any other
belief network on any other host, as a parent.
This opens a connection (managed by RMI) between the host containing the child
and the host containing the parent. Probability messages may flow in either
direction on this connection.
If the referred-to parent can't be located, an attempt is made to have 
the parent's belief network loaded onto the parent host;
this is similar in spirit to the resolution of names in ordinary function libraries.

<p> A reference to a belief network can be obtained from the RMI registry.
The registry maintains a list of belief network names and pointers to the
corresponding belief networks.
The registry listens for connections on port 1099 (by default), and 
translates names into references;
this is the mechanism used by child variables to obtain pointers to their parents.
When a new belief network is created,
its name is put into the registry.

<p> Belief networks are created and maintained by software called the 
belief network context. 
The context also has a name which is published in the RMI registry -- if you
want to start a belief network on a remote machine, you start by finding a 
context on that machine and requesting the context to start the belief network.
In general, belief networks can be loaded from the local filesystem or described
by a string.
Since the stub application prohibits access to the local filesystem,
belief networks can only be started remotely by sending a description string
to a belief network context.
Descriptions are typically several hundred bytes to a few thousand bytes in length.

<p> <h2> Security</h2>
At present, RISO includes only those security measures
provided by Java. 
These measures can prevent some denial of service and spoofing attacks.
RISO uses plain sockets, so all messages are transported in
the clear over the Internet.

<p> The RISO application stub (<tt>RemoteApp</tt>) executed on the
host machine prohibits any code which it loads from either reading
or writing the local filesystem.
The application stub allows unlimited socket connections -- these
connections are for the purpose of connecting to other belief network hosts.
The execution priority of the application stub (and so, the priority of
any belief network code) can be adjusted to suit the taste of the
administrator of the host, by the <tt>renice</tt> command, for example.

<p> <h2> Installation Overview</h2>
RISO can be installed in two different manners:
(1) either all the RISO classes can be installed on every 
host, or (2) the classes can be installed on one host,
with other hosts obtaining classes automatically through
the Java "codebase" mechanism.
Instructions are given for both installation methods.
Even if RISO is installed on only one host,
a distributed belief network can still be executed;
however, all the nodes in the network will have to be
on that one host.

<p>It's assumed in these instructions
that you have already
installed the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and/or
Java Development Kit (JDK).
You should be able to find a version of the JRE suitable for 
your system at <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>.

<p> RISO was mostly developed using versions 1.1.7 and 1.1.8,
but it can be recompiled with later versions;
I've used version 1.3 (IBM) successfully, although I haven't
tried version 1.4.
I don't know whether RISO compiled by one JDK version
will work successfully with another JRE or JDK.

<p> The JRE will take up several megabytes. It is possible to remove some large parts
which are not used by RISO (notably the GUI library and character set 
transliteration tables), but the result may still be
some megabytes.

<p> Instructions are given only for Unix; 
I don't have a Windows box to test the instructions.
To run on Windows, just "do the same thing" as in the
Unix instructions.


<p> <h2> Installation Details -- Stand-alone Host</h2>
<p>To install class files and run applications on one host:

	<ol>
	<li><p>Download the RISO class files.
	You want the most recent rpm labelled "riso-YYYYMMDD-N.noarch.rpm".
	The rpm installs a single file, "riso.jar".
	At this time (see the timestamp at bottom of this page)
	the most recent rpm is "riso-20020710-1.noarch.rpm".</p>

	<p>If you don't want an rpm installation, get the corresponding jar file.
	The jar file "riso-YYYYMMDD.jar" is identical to the jar
	file contained in the rpm.
	At this time, the jar file is "riso-20020710.jar".</p>
	</li>
	<li> <em>(Optional)</em> <p>Download and unpack the archives
	containing examples and documentation:
	"riso-20020129.javadoc.tar.gz", "riso-20020129.rates.tar.gz", and "riso-20020129.web.tar.gz".
	You don't need those files to complete these instructions.</p>

	<li><p>Execute "rpm -ih riso-YYYYMMDD-N.noarch.rpm". This will copy the
	content of the rpm to a standard location, 
	probably /usr/local/riso (but execute "rpm -qlp" to find out for sure).</p>

	<p>If you downloaded just the jar file, copy it to a standard location.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Set your classpath to point to the RISO jar file.
	For bash, it's something like "export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/riso/riso.jar:$CLASSPATH".</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Start the RMI registry: "rmiregistry &amp;"</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Start a belief network context: "java riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -c mycontext".
	Execute this command in a separate command window if possible; it will produce a lot of 
	debugging output.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>In another command window, load a belief network into the context:
	<pre>
cat &lt;&lt; EOF | java riso.apps.PublishNetworkString -c localhost/mycontext
riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetwork mybn
{
  riso.belief_nets.Variable X
  {
    type continuous
    distribution riso.distributions.Gaussian
    {
      mean 50
      std-deviation 17
    }
  }
}
EOF
	</pre>
	This is just one means of loading a belief network into a context.
	See <a href="bnc-pn-rq.html">these notes on using RISO programs</a>.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Now execute some application which gets a reference to the loaded belief network!
	For example (being careful about the spaces in the quoted string):
<pre>
echo '&gt; localhost/mybn ?' | java riso.apps.RemoteQuery
</pre>
should print out a copy of "mybn".
See <a href="bnc-pn-rq.html">these notes on using RISO programs</a>
for more information about how to use "RemoteQuery".</p>

<p>There are other RISO applications,
and it's easy to write more; all that "RemoteQuery" is doing is
	to use the RMI registry to obtain a remote reference, and then it's executing
	method calls using that reference. </p>
	</li>
</ol>


<p> <h2> Installation Details -- Client/server</h2>

In this scenario,
you install class files on one host, and load classes automatically from clients
using the Java "codebase" mechanism.
First follow the instructions above for the machine which will host the class files.
Then follow these instructions for each client:
	<ol>
	<li><p> <em>(On the server)</em>
	Install the RISO class files where they will be accessible by
	a web server on the host.
	For some web servers, a URL such as "http://somehost/~foo" resolves
	to the directory "/home/foo/public_html".
	In that case, 
<pre>
cd /home/foo/public_html
jar xvf /usr/local/riso/riso.jar
</pre>
	will unpack the files.</p>

	<p>You'll need to figure out what works on your server.</p>

	<li><p><em>(On the server)</em>
	Start up a web server on the host.
	For some web servers, it's something like
<pre>
cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
./httpd start
</pre>
	Again, you'll need to figure out how to do this on your system.</p>

	<p>There used to be a simple server distributed with Java,
	for the express purpose of serving files for RMI;
	maybe there still is. You might want to look into that.</p>

	<li> <p><em>(On the server)</em>
	Extract the stub application, <tt>RemoteApp.class</tt>. This is contained in one class file
	in riso.jar. 
	Use the command
<pre>
jar xvf /usr/local/riso/riso.jar riso.general.RemoteApp.class
</pre>
to extract "RemoteApp.class" (on the host).
Then copy "RemoteApp.class" to each client.</p>

<p><em>(On the client)</em>
	On each client,
	copy <tt>RemoteApp.class</tt> into a directory named <tt>riso/general</tt>.
	This is the only file that needs to be installed permanently on the client.</p>
	</li>
	<li> <p><em>(On the client)</em> Execute the RMI registry on each client.
<pre>
rmiregistry &amp;
</pre>
	</p>

	<li> <p><em>(On the client)</em> Create a belief network context using the stub application.</p>

	<p>Set environment variables to run the stub application.</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <p><tt>export CLASSPATH=riso/general:$CLASSPATH</tt></p>
		<li> <p><tt>export RISOHOST=the.class.file.server.something</tt></p>
		<li> <p><tt>export JAVALOCATION=~foo/or/something</tt></p>
		<li><p> <tt>export CODEBASE="java.rmi.server.codebase=http://$RISOHOST/$JAVALOCATION</tt></p>
		</ul>
		<p>IMPORTANT: Don't forget the trailing backslash on the codebase!</p>

		<p>Now execute the stub and tell it to execute the context in turn.</p>
	<pre>
java -D$CODEBASE RemoteApp -c riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -a -c my-context
	</pre>
	<p>This will product a lot of debugging information.</p>

	<!-- <p>
		It may be helpful
		to put the belief network context in a shell loop, so that if it
		dies (heaven forbid, of course),
		it will restart automatically. Here is one way to arrange that:
	<pre>
while true; do
  java -D$CODEBASE RemoteApp -c riso.belief_nets.BeliefNetworkContext -a -c my-context
done
	</pre>
		</ul>
		</p> -->

		<li> <tt>RemoteApp</tt> can execute other applications.
		See the <a href="bnc-pn-rq.html">notes
		on some RISO apps,</a> and these
		<a href="riso-misc.html">
		other notes on RISO apps</a>.
		<!-- The general syntax for <tt>RemoteApp</tt> is:
<pre>
java riso.general.RemoteApp -c NameOf_RISO_ClassHere -a ArgsForAppHere
</pre> -->
		
		<p> For example,
	<pre>
java riso.general.RemoteApp -c riso.general.RegistryPing -a $RISOHOST
	</pre>
	tells what belief networks and contexts are running on a particular host.</p>
	</ol>
</li>
</ul>
