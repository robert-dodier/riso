/** An instance of this class represents a conditional mixture model.
  * This is similar to an unconditional mixture (represented by the
  * <tt>Mixture</tt> class), but the mixing coefficients can vary with
  * the context (i.e., the parent variables). In the <tt>Mixture</tt> class,
  * mixing coefficients are stored in an array, since they don't change;
  * here, each mixing coefficient is returned by a function that takes the
  * context as an argument. In addition, the mixture components are
  * conditional distributions, not unconditional.
  *
  * <p> This class is declared <tt>abstract</tt> (i.e., it cannot be
  * instantiated) because there is no generic way to compute the mixing
  * coefficient function; each derived class implements that in its own way.
